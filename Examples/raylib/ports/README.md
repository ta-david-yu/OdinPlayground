These are ports of the official Raylib examples found [here](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html).

Because we mirror the structure of the original examples, they need to be run with `-file`, and for correct resource loading they need to be run from the same directory that they are in.

For example, to run the `shaders/shaders_mesh_instancing.odin` example:

1. `cd shaders`
2. `odin run shaders_mesh_instancing.odin -file`
